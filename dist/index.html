This is my first attempt at building a web-page from scratch as part of my initial training in coding, for the purpose of this project I will only be making use of HTML and basic CSS in order to better understand and use them. If, in the future I decide to update this code with more advanced languages, I will declare this in an additional comment further below. Your comments and suggestions are welcome, thank you for taking the time to check out my work.

          <p id="tribute-info">The purpose of this tribute page is to highlight the often overlooked distinction between the Khoekhoe(khoikhoi) and San peoples who inhabited what is now known as Cape Town and bring attention to the fact that there is no one group of Khoisan people, it is more an oversimplification for convenience-sake. There seems be a biased view of the mainstream media towards the colonists who settled in the Cape which has resulted in an unjustified dismissal of everything that took place before their arrival, which casts a shadow on the history, heritage and culture of the people who most likely are the real indigenes of the Cape.</br>My intention is not academic in nature, but simply to shine a light on this biased view, which I too was fed, and state that there is sufficient reason to re-examine and further explore the literature and human resources available to develop a more complete and un-biased picture of our history and the people who came before us.
